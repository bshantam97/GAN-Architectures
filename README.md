# GAN-Architectures

### Author
Shantam Bajpai 

### Architectures Implemented
1. DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative adversarial network)

2. WGAN (Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network)

3. WGAN With Gradient Penalty

4. CGAN (Conditional Generative adversarial network)

### Dataset Used
The dataset used to train the Generative adversarial networks was the celeba dataset which is a large scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K Celebrity faces.
